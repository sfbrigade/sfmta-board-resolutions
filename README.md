 # Inherited Technical portion of the Read.me from SF Crime Data
 

 ## Working in Github
  If you want to contribute to this project please follow these instructions:
  - fork the repository in to your account
  - open terminal, cd to a folder you want your files saved in.
  - clone from your repository:
  `git clone https://github.com/youraccount/sf-crime-data`
  - setup upstream to main repository:
  `git remote add upstream https://github.com/sfbrigade/sf-crime-data`
  - make sure your upstream and origin are correct:
  `git remote -v`
  - make edits in gh-pages branch:
  `git checkout gh-pages`
  - make changes from your local folder. Everytime you work on it make sure to pull any updates:
  `git pull upstream gh-pages`
  - When your ready to submit changes:
```
  git add <changed file names>
  git commit -m "type your message here"
  git push origin gh-pages
```
  - go to your git hub account in your browser and make a pull request from there. The dropdown should look like Main Repo/gh-pages to Forked Repo/gh-pages.

## Running Codebase Locally
If you want to download the github repository and run the code locally on your Apple machine,
- open terminal
- go to the folder directory
- run 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer'
- go to a browser and type in localhost:"PORT_NUMBER"


## Background in Technical Tools Used
* Add [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) plug-in to GitHub
  * Review how ZenHub works
* Review issues on ZenHub boards (within GitHub: sfbrigade/sf-crime-data)
* Clone the site to your dev machine and get it running locally
  * See readme.md "Running Codebase Locally"
  * See readme.md "Working in Github"
  * Alternately use your GitHub account's hosting option for gh-pages
  * Review how to call the API (Export)
* Visit [Mapbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/)
  * Review their map offerings
  * Review how to call the API
* If you want to contribute to the code base...
  * Set up a "public hosting" location like GitHub pages or Firebase
  	* This will be used to share your changes for team testing and code reviews
  * Comment on the issue you would like to work on
  * Continue to collaborate and code using Slack and GitHub
* If "life happens" and you won't have time to finish an issue due to new demands, do let us know, so we can re-assign.
